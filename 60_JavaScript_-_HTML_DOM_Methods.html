<!-- HTML DOM methods are actions you can perform (on HTML Elements). -->
<!-- HTML DOM properties are values (of HTML Elements) that you can set or change. -->


<!-- The DOM Programming Interface -->
<!-- The HTML DOM can be accessed with JavaScript (and with other programming languages). -->
<!-- In the DOM, all HTML elements are defined as objects. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<h2>My First Page</h2>

		<p id = "demo_1"></p>

		<script>
			document.getElementById("demo_1").innerHTML = "Hello World!";
		</script>
	</body>
</html>

<!-- In the example above, getElementById is a method, while innerHTML is a property -->
