<!-- JavaScript Object Prtotypes -->
<!-- Every JavaScript object has a prototype. The prototype is also an object. -->
<!-- All JavaScript objects inherit their properties and methods from their prototype -->

<!-- With a constructor function, you can use the new keyword to create new objects from the same prototype: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<p id = "demo_1"></p>

		<script>
			function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
				this.firstName = first;
				this.lastName = last;
				this.age = age;
				this.eyeColor = eye;
			}

			var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
			var myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

			document.getElementById("demo_1").innerHTML =
			"My father is " + myFather.age + ". My mother is " + myMother.age
		</script>
	</body>
</html>


<!-- Adding a Property to an Object -->
<!-- Adding a new property to an existing object is easy: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<p id = "demo_2"></p>

		<script>
			function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
				this.firstName = first;
				this.lastName = last;
				this.age = age;
				this.eyeColor = eye;
			}

			var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
			var myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

			myFather.nationality = "English";

			document.getElementById("demo_2").innerHTML = 
			"My father is " + myFather.nationality;
		</script>
	</body>
</html>

<!-- The property will be added to myFather. Not to myMother. Not to any other person objects. -->


<!-- Adding a Method to an Object -->
<!-- Adding a new method to an exxisting object is also easy: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<p id = "demo_3"></p>

		<script>
			function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
				this.firstName = first;
				this.lastName = last;
				this.age = age;
				this.eyeColor = eye;
			}
			var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
			var myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

			myFather.name = function() {
				return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
			};

			document.getElementById("demo_3").innerHTML =
			"My father is " + myFather.name();
		</script>
	</body>
</html>

<!-- The method will be added to myFather. Not to myMother. -->


<!-- Adding Properties to a Prototype -->
<!-- You cannot add a new property to a prototype the same way as you add a new property to an existing object, because the prototype is not an exisitng object. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<p id = "demo_4"></p>

		<p>The value of myFather.nationality is "undefined", because you cannot add a new property to a prototype the same way as you can add a new property to an exisitng object.</p>

		<script>
			function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
				this.firstName = first;
				this.lastName = last;
				this.age = age;
				this.eyeColor = eye;
			}
			Person.nationality = "English";

			var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
			var myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

			document.getElementById("demo_4").innerHTML = 
			"The nationality of my father is " + myFather.nationality;
		</script>
	</body>
</html>

<!-- To add a new property to a prototype, you must add it to the constructor function: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<p id = "demo_5"></p>

		<script>
			function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
				this.firstName = first;
				this.lastName = last;
				this.age = age;
				this.eyeColor = eye;
				this.nationality = "English";
			}

			var myFather = new Person ("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
			var myMother = new Person("Sally", "Rally", 48, "green");

			document.getElementById("demo_5").innerHTML =
			"My father is " + myFather.nationality + ". My mother is " + myMother.nationality + ".";
		</script>
	</body>
</html>

<!-- Prototype properties can have prototype value (defalut values). -->


<!-- Adding Methods to a Prototype -->
<!-- Your constructor function can also define methods: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<p id = "demo_6"></p>

		<script>
			function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
				this.firstName = first;
				this.lastName = last;
				this.age = age;
				this.eyeColor = eye;
				this.name = function() {
					return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName
				};
			}

			var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
			document.getElementById("demo_6").innerHTML =
			"My father is " + myFather.name();
		</script>
	</body>
</html>


<!-- Using the prototype Property -->
<!-- The JavaScript prototype property allows you to add new properties to an existing prototype -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<p id = "demo_7"></p>

		<script>
			function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
				this.firstName = first;
				this.lastName = last;
				this.age = age;
				this.eyeColor = eye;
			}
			Person.prototype.nationality = "English";

			var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
			document.getElementById("demo_7").innerHTML =
			"My father is " + myFather.nationality;
		</script>
	</body>
</html>

<!-- The JavaScript prototype property also allows you to add new methods to an exisitng protptye: -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<body>
		<p id = "demo_8"></p>

		<script>
			function Person(first, last, age, eye) {
				this.firstName = first;
				this.lastName = last;
				this.age = age;
				this.eyeColor = eye;
			}
			Person.prototype.name = function() {
				return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName
			};

			var myFather = new Person("John", "Doe", 50, "blue");
			document.getElementById("demo_8").innerHTML =
			"My father is " + myFather.name();
		</script>
	</body>
</html>

<!-- Only modify your own prototype. Never modify the prototype of standard JavaScript objects. -->
